5.1 Dissecting Promise.all(): 
Implement your own version of Promise.all() leveraging promises, async/await, or a combination of the two. The function must be functionally equivalent to its original counterpart.


promise.all(arr of promise) ->  after every promise is resolve -> return every promise status..... 
if there's reject -> immediately return fasle?
